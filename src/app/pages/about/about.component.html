    <p class="aboutIntroduction">
        Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Youri Janssen and I am a junior software developer.
        I am currently in my second year and last year of the Associate Degree Software Development
        at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. During my previous education I studied Arts
        & Economics at the HKU. I finished the enrollment, but did not see my future in its
        workfield (music management and event organization). My final graduation project involved
        the creation of a website/webshop for a struggeling soccer club. I created a prototype for
        it and a business plan. I enjoyed the process of prototyping, but until then never really
        understood how an actual website was created. My interest in programming started to grow and
        I decided to enroll in the Software Development course at the HVA. Now I consider myself a
        good programmer that understands the key concepts of it. In the near future I want to learn
        more in a real working environment, instead of the simulated school environment. I am
        looking for a company that can help me grow as a developer and where I can contribute to the
        company's success. I am a fast learner and I am not afraid to ask questions.
